                        <p>Why CS + Math? That's because those are my two academic passions. Some say math is a language.
                            The way one can express complex statements in math has lead me to believe that this is true.
                            Math is a way to express the realm of numbers, and computer science draws very heavily upon that fact.
                            Computer science is prevalent in anything and everything in this increasingly 
                            technology-driven world. Therefore, those that are coming up learning this powerful
                        tool that is the development of technology are the future.</p><br>
                        <p>Other than coding, I am a huge Los Angeles Lakers fan (and just a basketball fan in general).
                            Furthermore, during this COVID-19 pandemic, I discovered weightlifting, which has become as much
                            of a passion for me as programming has.</p><br>
